-- 1.) Load the given dataset into snowflake with a primary key to Order Date column.
CREATE or replace table SALES_DATA
(    order_id VARCHAR2(30),
     order_date VARCHAR2(30) PRIMARY KEY,
     ship_date VARCHAR2(30),
     ship_mode VARCHAR2(30),
     customer_name VARCHAR2(50),
     segment VARCHAR2(50),
     state VARCHAR2(50),
     country VARCHAR2(50),
     market VARCHAR2(50),
     region VARCHAR(50),
     product_id VARCHAR2(50),
     category VARCHAR2(40),
     sub_category VARCHAR2(90),
     product_name string,
     sales int,
     quantity number,
     discount float,
     profit float,
     shipping_cost float,
     order_priority CHAR(50),
     year int
);


-- 2.) Change the Primary key to Order Id Column.
ALTER TABLE SALES_DATA
DROP PRIMARY KEY;

alter table SALES_DATA
ADD PRIMARY KEY (order_id);


-- 3.) Check the data type for Order date and Ship date and mention in what data type it should be?
alter table SALES_DATA
alter order_date set data type date;

alter table SALES_DATA
alter ship_date set data type date;


-- 4.) Create a new column called order_extract and extract the number after the last ‘–‘from Order ID column.
SELECT SPLIT_PART(ORDER_ID, '-', 3) AS order_extract
FROM SALES_DATA; 


-- 5.) Create a new column called Discount Flag and categorize it based on discount. Use ‘Yes’ if the discount is greater than zero else ‘No’.
select *, case
     when DISCOUNT>0 then 'YES'
     else 'NO'
   end as Discount_Flag
from SALES_DATA;


-- FIND OUT THE FINAL PROFIT AND PUT IT IN COLUMN FOR EVERY ORDER ID. (THIS QUESTION WAS NOT IN AN ASSIGNMENT OF DASHBOARD BUT SIR HAS GIVEN THIS QUESTION TO DO !!)
SELECT order_id, SUM(profit) AS final_profit FROM SALES_DATA GROUP BY order_id;


--6.) Create a new column called process days and calculate how many days it takes for each order id to process from the order to its shipment.
select datediff(day,ORDER_DATE,SHIP_DATE) as process_days from SALES_DATA;  



-- 7.) Create a new column called Rating and then based on the Process dates give rating like given below.
--       a. If process days less than or equal to 3days then rating should be 5
--       b. If process days are greater than 3 and less than or equal to 6 then rating should be 4
--       c. If process days are greater than 6 and less than or equal to 10 then rating should be 3
--       d. If process days are greater than 10 then the rating should be 2.

select *,datediff(day,ORDER_DATE,SHIP_DATE) as process_days, 
case
      when process_days<=3 then '5'
      when process_days>3 and process_days<=6 then '4'
      when process_days>6 and process_days<=10 then '3'
    else '2'
  end as Rating
from SALES_DATA;
